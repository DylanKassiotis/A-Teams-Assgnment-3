    <p>The primary Tools used by the A team were Atom for programming and compiling.
      Secondly,
      GitHub for storing and hosting the website. Thirdly, Microsoft Teams was used as the main
      communication tool. Additionally, the Task application was used in MS Teams for project
      management and delegating objectives to team members. As a result, The GitHub
      repository does not accurately depict the groups contributions. </p>

    <h2><strong>Dylan Kassiotis</strong> - S3856097 <br> Project Manager & Project Designer | The A Team </h2>
    <p>A strength that the A team had was the ability to complete a large quantity of work on a
      short schedule. Also, the vast range of skills really allowed the team members to use their
      strengths such as Mignone with reviewing, Sarah with writing, formatting and reviewing
      and Benjamin with the creativity of the project idea and writing. On the other hand, the A
      team faced challenges such as inactive teammates, people joining late, late responses and
      not knowing if a group member is working on their objectives. For this reason, I believe in
      future, we would need to implement better and quicker communication tools and Activity
      monitoring systems to see what a group member is currently working on. There were many
      surprises such as, Sarah, who helped tremendously with writing and formatting, Benjamin
      who was vital to the project’s implementation and Mignone who also helped with some
      writing and reviewing. In conclusion, there were many surprises, negatives and positives
      with being in a group environment. However, one thing I have learned is that
      communication and structured project management is vital for a team.</p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Sarah Inwood</strong> - S3886560 <br> Project administrator | The A Team
    </h2>
    <p>We only had a few weeks to come together and create our project. Through the start to
      finalising the result, we all put together our Independent and team leadership skills to
      coincide with the complete aspect. The A-Team had successfully completed all aspects of the
      group’s assignment tasks on time.
      Dylan worked through the GitHub repositories to design the website.
      Dylan and Benjamin worked on the aspects of the artefact with depth and design.
      Mignone focused on the writing and reviewing and helping others.
      Sarah complied and formatted the documents.
      The A-team: finalising the finishing results, we worked well together in collaboration.
      Dylan, Benjamin, Mignone and Sarah all contributed as a group to write our project.</p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Mignone Tshamala </strong> - s3409202 <br>Project Team Assistant | The A Team </h2>
    <p>It has been challenging creating our group profile. The difficulties have been mainly in
      coordinating everybody ideas while keeping the objective of the project as a denominator.
      Time constraint has also been a challenge especially submitting the project on time.
      Distribution of tasks amongst ourselves; was easy but keeping up to date with each other
      has also been difficult.
      Good we have tried to maintain good communication. In the end everything works out well
      as putting different people idea together which have flourish into a well design project. We
      are keeping our fingers cross for the outcome.</p>
    <br>

    <h2><strong>Benjamin Wong</strong> - S3884028  <br> Project Producer and Writer | The A Team  </h2>
    <p>Working with the team has been a pleasing experience. At times we lacked cohesiveness
      with our expectations of each other and this caused a bit of turbulence, but this can be
      attributed to psychological differences and is something any team is likely to encounter. On
      the other hand, it was a relief to have cooperative teammates willing to make sacrifices for
      the sake of the project. Dylan’s organisational skills and workflow complemented my desire
      to have a picture of what’s going on and what I’m doing relative to everybody else, though I
      feel some members lacked the initiative to take advantage of this tool proactively. It was
      surprising and unfortunate to have a group member leave, and this put a greater strain on
      the rest of us to deliver a product consistent with our original expectations. However, I’m
      sure most of us learnt that the path to success lies within the human spirit, I.e. when we
      strive to do our best regardless of the situation at hand.</p>
