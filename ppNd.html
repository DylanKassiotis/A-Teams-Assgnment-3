  <!-- TOPIC  -->
  <h3>Topic</h3>
  <p>Our project idea involves a health website which provides practical, applicable strategies to
    improve one’s health using wisdom from a variety of traditional health systems such as
    Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern Western science. The goal is to
    empower laypersons and middle-class workers to make better decisions with ideas and
    concepts tailored to their body profile, so we don’t resort to pharmaceutical medicine,
    doctors and the next fad diet to ‘magically fix’ basic health issues.
    The website would feature a series of tests, provide the user with a profile and also include
    a blog which would elaborate on the ideas presented in the profile. As time goes on, a
    neural network could be added, and this would increase the value of the site
    drastically. The website could also host practitioners who are interested in contributing to
    the project.</p>

  <!-- MOTIVATION  -->
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>In my personal experience, a lot of us (myself included) can fall out of touch with our bodies
    and live life making repeated mistakes in food choices. Nowadays it’s common to suffer
    from lupus, blood sugar imbalances, etc. – and most of the time it isn’t necessary. In other
    words, laxatives are a quick fix, but the root cause of one’s constipation is probably their
    own choices. Unfortunately, ancient, modern and naturopathic practitioners always seem to be at odds with one another because somebody’s livelihood is at stake, rather than seeing
    where they fall short and others shine.
    To a potential employer, this project would show website and java (test app) programming
    skills, web design skills and the ability to work as a team.</p>
  <!-- END OF MOTIVATION  -->

  <!-- LANDSCAPE  -->
  <h3>Landscape</h3>
  <p>Most websites deal with information sparsely as blog posts, or centre on one strategy (paleo,
    keto, etc.) and push it as something everybody should do, when statistics and data show
    that this is not at all wise. There are a few sites on Ayurveda, and the material on TCM is
    extremely limited. In short, there are no health websites currently that provide information
    from a variety of perspectives; most are limited to one school of thought without any kind of
    critical analysis.</p>
  <br>
  <!-- END OF LANDSCAPE  -->


  <h2>Detailed Description</h2>

  <h3>Aims</h3>
  <p>Our project’s aim is to create a health website that provides users with strategies based on
    a blend of ancient wisdom and modern naturopathic science. The main feature of the site is
    a test that returns a user-generated profile, and a health blog which elaborates on ideas
    from various schools of thought. The purpose of the site is to help people build confidence in
    their every-day decision making, optimize their health and achieve a greater level of
    balance in life. </p>
  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <h4>Rent a Domain</h4>
  <p>In the beginning this will be a relatively small-scale project, so it makes sense to first rent a
    domain and upscale if the site gains a lot of traffic. There are many sites out there with
    which to register a domain, for example domain.com. </p>

  <h4>Create Blog Material, or Source a Practitioner</h4>
  <p>The website’s core or most valuable part will be the blog, as this is where the information is.
    A team member could attend a school or course, but ultimately practitioners (preferably
    qualified, to build audience confidence, ensure the integrity of the site and to bring real-life
    experience to the project) who like the project and are willing to contribute will have to be
    sourced. Each school of thought is specialized, so it’s not likely any one person will be able
    to write the blog themselves beyond a superficial level. </p>

  <h4>Hire a Graphic Designer/Web Developer
  </h4>
  <p>Simply coding a blog may be simple enough, but as the team adds more features to the
    website such as user accounts/profiles and a test, a higher level of skill will be required. If
    necessary, the team could post job advertisements on Jobseeker or Seek, hold interviews
    and find somebody looking for a short-term contract to set the site up. Preferably they
    would also have graphic design skills to create visuals to reinforce ideas in the blog. </p>

  <h4>Design a Test + User-Generated Profile</h4>
  <p>Here the project’s creative lead will consult the various practitioners involved in the site to
    devise formulas and parameters for a test and send these to the web developer, who will
    code them into an applet. The test will cover the basic somatotypes and cross-check answers
    to identify a predisposition to various ailments, then generate a profile containing various
    preventative strategies, either dietary or lifestyle-based (or both). </p>

  <h4>Internal Testing + Beta Testing</h4>
  <p>The team will either test the first few iterations themselves or hire a group of beta testers
    (this is discussed under ‘testing’). However, as no project is perfect on first release it seems
    wise to continue iterating on the test as a beta to receive user feedback on how the
    UI/interface could be improved, catch bugs, etc. When the team is confident the test
    operates properly and delivers results accurately, true to how these things would be seen in
    the field, then we will move on to the final release.</p>

  <br><br>

  <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

  <h4>Health Blog </h4>
  <p>The health blog forms the core of the website and will be comprised mostly of lowerresolution information (i.e., body types, information to do with the senses, tastes, dryness
    vs. dampness in the body, which foods are considered tonics for certain organs, etc.) from
    Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. This kind of information is the most readily
    applicable in everyday life and will produce the most immediate results and is what will
    attract most people to the website. To attain the information, a practitioner could
    be sourced, or one could do the research/attend a school themselves. The blogs will be
    drafted by a practitioner, sent to the team to be edited/screened, then delivered to the web
    developer. Which will code them into the website and create/add visuals as specified to the
    core structure and represented data and figures.
    The blog will be organised under several categories, such as: </p>
  <img src="Images\HEalthBlogGraph.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
  <p>These will be accessible either from a drop-down menu or a sidebar. </p>
  <h4>Design a Test </h4>
  <p>For the website to have a user-generated profile, it must also have a test that takes
    inputs. For test design, an experienced programmer would be hired and work together with
    one or more specialists. The test also encourages users to think about and identify various
    features of their body and if/how they fit together to form a picture or archetype. Test
    parameters would include typical indicators of body type and lifestyle such as BMI, waistto-hip ratio, fingers encircling the wrist, facial features, skin health, personal and family
    health history, etc. The way these inputs interact with one another determines the generated profile <i> (I.e., high waist-to-hip ratio + cold, oily skin + circulatory issues -->
      ‘kapha’-type strategy & foods).</i> </p>
  <br>
  <p>These inputs will be stored in the back end and called upon by an algorithm devised by the
    project lead and several practitioners when generating the user profile. For writing the test
    and coding the website the team will look for a programmer specialising in java or C++, as
    these are the most widely used and accessible languages. As java applets are no longer in
    fashion, it is more likely the test will be coded directly into the website. </p>
  <h4>Accounts & User-generated Profile
  </h4>
  <p>The site will host user accounts within which their test results & information will be stored.
    They will also be able to optionally enter their emails and receive updates on, for example,
    when the test gets a new feature, or an original blog post is added. </p>
  <p>The user-generated profile will return the primary features of their body profile on the
    macro-level, as well as lower-resolution and higher-resolution strategies to maintain
    balance. Lower-resolution strategies are those that follow the advice of ancient wisdom and
    are quite generally applicable (e.g., incorporating the six tastes and which ones to
    emphasize, or dryness vs dampness in the body). Higher-resolution strategies are based on
    modern science, and may include the macro-aspects of a diet, the recommendation of
    specific herbs/supplements and certain practices and exercises (e.g., fasting and how to fast,
    exercise for cardiovascular health, meditation, etc.).
    The most important part of the website is the blog. However, the user-generated profile is
    where the user connects the dots between their inputs and recommended strategies and
    receives the most immediately relevant and useful information. They may also find
    recommendations they would have missed or otherwise not considered.</p>
  <h4>Progress</h4>
  <p>Our project had a late start; reasons for this are unclear, group members were busy with
    other work. Our first meeting was on the 14th; in this meeting we decided to create a health
    website because it had received the best feedback in previous assessments, and the group
    members seemed happy with the idea. In this meeting Dylan also gained inspiration to
    create a more organised environment using Microsoft Teams to improve the group’s
    workflow and efficiency. Over the following days we divided up the project and delegated
    the work amongst ourselves. </p>
  <p>During the first week Dylan created the website using web-coding skills he gained during
    previous assessments. Benjamin continued forming a vision of the website this time more
    concretely, considering its features, how it would look and new additions to the step-by-step
    development such as the beta test. Dylan analysed our personal information and developed
    a team profile, Sarah further detailed and outlined roles for the team, & Mignone
    brainstormed other tools & technologies we could use in the project. Each piece of work was
    reviewed by various members, Dylan, Sarah, and Benjamin. Unfortunately, Steven left the
    group in the last week, but we readjusted without much trouble. </p>
  <p>Project development has been quite linear, with no real deviations from plan. Currently we
    are developing a prototype for the website now that our group is organised & plans are laid
    out. These will be rough, conceptual drafts demonstrating content, how the pages are
    structured and how the visuals support the text, which we will then implement in a webpage. There are three prototypes; a mock blog, test page and resulting profile (see
    below). This webpage can be used as a proof-of-concept when discussing the idea with
    potential blog contributors and when hiring a lead web-developer or graphic designer.
  </p>

  <h4>Outcomes:</h4>
  <p>Working in collaboration with the team, the project was planned and structured from a
    timeline and outcomes reflected on our progress leading up to the design and implementing
    the layout. As per our plan stages the most critical parts are designing and implementing
    the project to coincide with the process of planned events. This included a health blog,
    testing the prototype, sourcing the database of website input, and embedding that into the
    source of transcript of user profile and data. This would allow the planed outcomes to be
    generated through the channels of communication and project planning stages; right
    through to the design, outlay and presentation of the imbedded data, formatted to create a
    user space for the porotype, in this case being the health industries representing a database
    of using one system to source health.
    Our final product is a blog website (blog type) where users details are recorded as well as
    ancient and new medical information. The later are updated by the core blog users and
    administrator who might source their information from in build blog information. The blog
    administrator will police the traffic in the blog as well the any new input from the blogger.
    The blog member will have to declare their financial interest if any when advising or giving
    answer to the blog questions. The Blog will be public, but the get access it will be required
    basic information from the user in a form of a log in and password. People who wish to surf
    without logging in will be allowed to get basic health information. Questions can be asked
    by the member of public and an informed answer will be delivered after the administrator
    has dispatched the question to the previously registered blogger. The turn-over question to
    answer will be 48 hours.
    A disclaimer will usually be signed to legally protect the core blogger who will answer the
    question to his best knowledge.</p>

  <!-- SCOPES AND LIMITS -->
  <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Project needs:</h4>
  <p>To understand the modern science of medical history and terms of a useful dictionary,
    medical systems and database. To extract and Embed forceful information to the global
    public to enable discussions into society; through the philosophy of medicine, science and
    technology combined. This enables the source of information to be worldwide and
    structured of the scope of a whole. </p>

  <h4>Goal and objectives - </h4>
  <p>A modern medical system of a dictionary to facilitate many different uses of medicine
    through channels of past medicine, such as western medicine, ancient medicine, traditional
    medicine, Chinese medicine, yin and yang therapies, Australian medicine concepts and any
    type of medical input in-between through a global part etc. To help understand the nature
    of aiding the population through a knowledge of medical resources. Tools to understand
    unique philosophy and medical terms/ dictionary and a combined system of alternative
    medicine of health including from old versions of concepts such as; natural products, mindbody therapies, alternative medical systems, manipulative and body-based methods, energy
    therapies into one database. Timeframe up to 6 months, to extract and demonstrate a
    database and blogs, and technical website, with forums. This is an ongoing development. </p>

  <h4>Project scope description:</h4>
  <p>Building the website with logo and marketing strategies involved to acquire people to
    embed and put input into through discussions. The network activity of the website will
    indicate statistics and data analyzed to market the website effectively. Having a system
    that would allow the structuring of previous medical information to source the new
    information into the database. </p>

  <h4>Expectations and expectance:</h4>
  <p>To clarify medical misconceptions and help build a better understanding of medical science.
    The audience being; the project team members, the community and health practitioners
    and experts. </p>

  <h4>Identity constraints:</h4>
  <p>Time consuming to gather the old sources and embed and generate them into one website of
    a large database. Having enough cloud space would be costly. Health practitioners and
    health experts might not see eye to eye in views. Forums could create objections or bias
    opinions on the medical view; for example, one might be fixated on views on Chinese
    medicine and another might not see the views of traditional medicine. </p>

  <h4>Identify necessary changes:
  </h4>
  <p>Have a strong sense of stakeholders and sponsors on the project. From internal and
    external sources would help create the level of project work a source structured to
    revolutionize the system of medical database. </p>
  <!-- END OF SCOPES AND LIMITS -->

  <!-- TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES -->
  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p>With a skilled enough programmer, the tests could be designed using JavaScript or another
    programming language such as Python. Soon virtual intelligence or machine learning is
    used, provided there is enough medical information to train it on and therefore enough
    institutional support for the project. The website would simply display a different
    profile/profile element depending upon the archetype indicated by the specific combination
    of user inputs. I would hire my own domain and use custom-made templates. Graphic
    designers would also be needed to make the information presentable; it would be light
    work, only one or two required. Finally, passionate practitioners who want to share their
    wisdom with other people. This is the hardest area, as I do not have any qualifications.
    We will take advantage of recent development of popular interactive apps and programs. I
    will use zoom or online webinar session to interact with a large audience. The discussion in
    the blog will be preceded by topics sharing before the discussion. A WhatsApp group can be
    created to circulate information within the blog -group. The selection of the topic will be
    driven by the blog administrator and admission will also be voluntary. Post will be entered
    using hypertext markup language (HTML) in a reverse chronology so that the most recent
    will appear first followed by the subsequent one. Also, documents will be stored or displays
    following their semantic. In our case, medical topics will be stored following the different
    traditional branches of medicine (Obstetrics-Gynecology, Internal Medicine, Pediatric,
    Surgery and General practice).</p>
  <h4>Tool and tech from group members:</h4>
  <p>Upon the much-observed resources we have used including Microsoft teams; the group has
    gained knowledge in other planforms like GitHub, web building tools, and PowerPoint,
    work documents. Also using resources like share point data tools to assist with review and
    editing. </p>
  <!-- END OF TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES -->

  <!-- TESTING -->
  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>As our project is a website, there will be little testing required. Blog drafts will be screened
    and edited before they are uploaded; otherwise, most testing will occur in the test and profile design. Essentially, we will know the website works when the application and
    generated profile match the set of pre-devised parameters and formulas initially sent to the
    programmer. The bug hunting process could be made faster by delegating each team
    member with a certain subset of formulas to test, or by hiring a group of testers, though
    this would not likely be necessary as it would be light work between 5-6 people. Given that
    the formulas are provided, testers would only need basic intuitive knowledge of math and
    the internet. The website could also release a beta test for members who have signed up for
    the blog to test; this would be a more efficient but less comprehensive way of making sure
    the program works (more likely to catch random visual bugs, etc.) and the site operator
    could gather feedback from users to further improve the visuals, test format, site layout,
    etc. Success will mean delivering a well-iterated product that functions according to
    specifications; the inputs will match the outputs, the interface will be clean and intuitive,
    and the back end will relate information properly to the front-end without any holes, bugs
    or glitches.</p>
  <!-- END OF TESTING -->

  <!-- RISKS -->
  <h3>Risks</h3>
  <p>Risks within this project are mostly to do with communication and integrity of vision. For
    example, there is always the risk a graphic designer may not share passion for the project
    and deliver a product lacking conceptual or ideological consistency, or a blog contributor
    may provide shallow or inaccurate information. Therefore, the screening process is
    important. To consider other aspects, important care should be taken when interviewing
    and selecting potential collaborators (I.e., only accept those with a portfolio, preferably of
    original ideas/projects); this should not be rushed. </p>

  <p>In test design, there is also the risk a programmer will create an applet using software
    incompatible with the website, or that cannot be properly embedded, etc. If the team
    chooses to follow this route, it will be important to specify to the programmer a medium
    that can be easily integrated with the website. </p>

  <p>Finally, as the site will hold sensitive information tied to user accounts it runs the risk of a
    security breach. In addition to standard measures (e.g., requiring passwords to include a
    variety of symbols), it would be wise to encrypt the data or place it behind other security
    measures. This could be included in the programmer’s job description, or a cyber security
    specialist could be separately hired. </p>

  <!-- GROUP PRO AND COMMUNE -->

  <h3>Group processes and comminications</h3>
  <p>Project management is a vital part of working on projects as a group. Communication is
    important as a whole factor, working as a team and building the project together as a
    whole. There are many communication strategies with platforms to assist in working online
    through collaboration and is very important that the project is planned out and structured
    accordingly. When working as a team, circumstances could prevail the team due to
    situations that are unforeseen; however, the project manners communication to other
    parties are will structure the project to assign tasks and rotate performance around. </p>

  <p>Our team established connections, given a late start and low commitment of members on
    the team; we assured the team is actively and engaged; initially set up through Microsoft
    teams and conducted meetings via calls through the Microsoft team’s software platform.
    Our team project had a short time to allocate tasks, so we began frequently conducting the
    necessary requirements every day to receive on update of the project. Through this platform
    we connected and chatted and conducted regular initial meetings that took place. If needed
    additional meetings where catered for and organized. The project manager assigned tasks
    to the Microsoft teams to do list and planner, so each team member could clearly set which
    tasks where assigned. With effective strategies we did organize, we assigned roles to each
    team member to represent the work that was required. <br><br>To summarize the project of group work and communications; the outcomes are considered
    to clarify our work together as a group and the short time frame of deadline that was meet.
    The project outlines commitment with communication, working together and building
    relationships as a team, cooperation, assertiveness, productivity;</p>
